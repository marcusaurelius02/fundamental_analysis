## 1. Business Overview

Havells India (HQ: Noida, UP) is one of India's largest and most diversified electrical equipment companies. Originally a switchgear company, it has transformed into a full-range consumer electricals and durables conglomerate. The 2017 acquisition of Lloyd (Fedders Lloyd consumer brand) added ACs, TVs, and washing machines — creating a premium consumer durables play.

### Business Segments (FY25 Revenue Mix)

| Segment | Revenue Share | Q3 FY26 Revenue | Q3 FY26 YoY |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| Cables & Wires | ~32% | ₹2,241 cr | +32.8% ✅ |
| Electrical Consumer Durables (ECD) | ~24% | ₹1,151 cr | +4.3% |
| Lloyd Consumer (AC, TV, WM) | ~12% | ₹694 cr | -6.5% ⚠️ |
| Switchgears | ~11% | ₹624 cr | +8.2% |
| Lighting & Fixtures | ~7% | ₹423 cr | -4.0% ⚠️ |
| Others | ~14% | — | — |

**Total Q3 FY26 Revenue:** ₹5,588 cr (+14.3% YoY) — largely driven by Cables surge

### Distribution Strength
- Retailer base: 260,000 (up from 100,000 in FY16)
- Electrician network: 301,000 (up from 150,000 in FY16)
- Pan-India coverage — significantly stronger than V-Guard outside South India

## 2. Financial Performance (5-Year History)

### Revenue & Profit Trend

| Year | Revenue (₹ cr) | PAT (₹ cr) | EBITDA Margin | Net Margin | EPS (₹) |
|------|---------------|-----------|--------------|------------|---------|
| FY21 | 10,645 | 897 | ~9.5% | ~8.4% | 14.3 |
| FY22 | 14,378 | 1,197 | ~10.2% | ~8.3% | 19.1 |
| FY23 | 16,300 (est) | 1,072 | ~9.5% | ~6.6% | 17.1 |
| FY24 | 18,839 | 1,271 | 10.1% | 6.8% | 20.3 |
| FY25 | 22,081 | 1,470 | 9.9% | 6.8% | 23.5 |

**5-Year Revenue CAGR:** 20.0%
**5-Year PAT CAGR:** 8.9% — Significant divergence: revenue grew faster than profits, indicating margin pressure from Lloyd integration and commodity volatility.

### ⚠️ FY26 Growth Slowdown — Key Concern

| Period | Revenue (₹ cr) | YoY Growth | PAT (₹ cr) | YoY Growth |
|--------|---------------|------------|-----------|------------|
| 9M FY26 | 15,823 | +4.87% | 968 | +3.85% |
| Q3 FY26 | 5,588 | +14.3% | 300 | +7.9% |

**9M FY26 growth of just 4.87% revenue and 3.85% PAT is well below the 17-20% revenue CAGR investors had priced in.** Q3 showed recovery driven by cables but Lloyd and lighting remain drags.

**FY26 Full Year Estimate (with strong Q4 FY26):**
- Revenue: ~₹21,500-22,500 cr (flat to +2% vs FY25)
- PAT: ~₹1,450-1,550 cr (~flat)
- EPS FY26 estimate: ₹23-25

## 3. Key Financial Ratios

| Metric | FY24 | FY25 | Industry Benchmark |
|--------|------|------|-------------------|
| ROCE | 24.1% | 24.8% | >20% (good) |
| ROE | 17.1% | 17.7% | >18% |
| EBITDA Margin | 10.1% | 9.9% | 9-13% |
| Net Margin | 6.8% | 6.8% | 5-8% |
| ROA | 10.6% | 10.8% | >10% (strong) |
| Debt/Equity | ~0 | ~0 | Near zero |
| Working Capital | High (cable + Lloyd inventory) | Elevated | ⚠️ Watch |

**Balance Sheet:** Debt-free. BUT working capital intensity is high — especially from Lloyd AC inventory buildup and cable segment receivables. This is a cash-drag risk in FY26.

## 4. Moat Analysis

| Moat Type | Rating (1-5) | Assessment |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Brand | 5/5 | Top-3 pan-India brand in electricals. Premium positioning, 260,000 retailers. |
| Distribution | 5/5 | Deepest retail + electrician network in India. Unmatched channel penetration. |
| Cost Advantage | 3/5 | Scale benefits in cables; Lloyd still sub-scale in ACs |
| Switching Costs | 3/5 | Switchgears have stickiness (specifications); cables lower |
| Network Effect | 2/5 | Electrician loyalty program creates some stickiness |
| Scale | 4/5 | 4x the size of V-Guard; #2-3 in most categories |

**Overall Moat: WIDE** — Brand + distribution depth is Havells' key durable advantage. Lloyd is a moat-building effort (AC is 3mn unit capacity now) but profitability is uncertain.

---

## 5. Management Quality

- **Promoter:** Qimat Rai Gupta family. Professional management with strong promoter oversight.
- **Capital Allocation:** FY26 capex of ₹1,450 cr (high), FY27 estimated ₹1,000 cr — aggressive but aligns with cables + Lloyd capacity expansion.
- **Lloyd Strategy:** Acquired for ₹1,600 cr in 2017. Took 7+ years to approach profitability (turned profitable FY25). Q3 FY26 AC revenue -6.5% due to inventory overhang — management citing channel support schemes as drag.
- **Dividend Policy:** ₹4/share interim dividend declared Q3 FY26 — consistent.
- **Red Flags:**
  - Lloyd AC losses dragged earnings for 5+ years post-acquisition
  - 9M FY26 growth of ~5% vs priced-in 17-20% expectation = execution gap
  - Working capital build-up (channel financing for ACs) = cash drag
  - Lighting & Fixtures declining — structural headwind from commodity LED commoditization

## 6. Competitive Position vs Peers

| Company | Revenue (FY25) | EBITDA Margin | ROCE | P/E (TTM) | Moat |
|---------|---------------|--------------|------|-----------|------|
| **Havells** | ₹22,081 cr | 9.9% | 24.8% | ~58x | Wide |
| Polycab India | ~₹21,000 cr | 13-14% | 28-30% | ~46x | Wide |
| V-Guard | ₹5,599 cr | 9.2% | 21.4% | ~47x | Narrow |
| Crompton Consumer | ~₹6,800 cr | 11-12% | 20% | ~40x | Moderate |
| Blue Star | ~₹11,000 cr | 7-8% | 18-20% | ~65x | Moderate |

**Key takeaway:** Havells at 58x P/E is the MOST EXPENSIVE in the peer set on an absolute and relative basis. Polycab has better margins, better ROCE, and trades cheaper. Havells' premium is justified only if Lloyd delivers strong AC growth — currently that thesis is under stress.

## 7. Growth Drivers & Risks

### Growth Drivers
1. **Cables mega-cycle:** Real estate + infra boom driving cables demand; Q3 FY26 cables +32.8% — strong near-term tailwind
2. **Lloyd AC scale-up:** 3mn unit capacity; if FY27 summer is strong, Lloyd could deliver 20-30% growth
3. **ECD premiumisation:** BLDC fans, AI-enabled ACs, IoT appliances — pricing power in premium segment
4. **Electrician loyalty:** 301,000 electrician network creates ground-level pull through
5. **Rural expansion:** Management guided for positive momentum in rural markets

### Risks
1. **Lloyd drags margin:** AC segment -6.5% in Q3 FY26; channel inventory overhang, competitive pricing pressure from Voltas/Blue Star/Daikin
2. **Copper price spike:** Cables segment (32% of revenue) is fully exposed to copper prices; any sharp commodity rally hits margins
3. **Valuation risk:** 58x P/E with 4.87% revenue growth in 9M FY26 = dangerous combination. If FY26 PAT is flat, P/E expands to 60x+ on current price — re-rating risk is high
4. **Lighting structural decline:** LED commoditization making lighting a low-margin commodity; -4% in Q3 FY26
5. **Working capital:** High inventory/receivables in cables + Lloyd = 6-8% cash ROE drag vs reported

## 8. Valuation

### Intrinsic Value Calculation

| Method | Bear | Base | Bull |
|--------|------|------|------|
| P/E (EPS ₹24 FY26E) | ₹1,080 (45x) | ₹1,320 (55x) | ₹1,560 (65x) |
| P/E (EPS ₹27 FY27E) | ₹1,215 (45x) | ₹1,485 (55x) | ₹1,755 (65x) |
| Historical median P/E (~52x) | — | ₹1,250 (FY26E) | ₹1,400 (FY27E) |

**Fair Value Range:**
- FY26 basis: ₹1,100-1,400 (at current ₹1,379 = near top of range)
- FY27 basis: ₹1,300-1,600 (if growth recovers to 12-15%)

**CMP ₹1,379 = FAIRLY TO FULLY VALUED on FY26 basis, with no margin of safety at current growth trajectory.**

### Your Entry vs Fair Value
- Avg buy: ₹1,450.73 → slightly above base fair value → **underwater for a reason**
- CMP ₹1,379.40 → 4.9% below your avg
- For break-even: needs to recover to ₹1,451
- For 10% profit: ₹1,596

## 9. Technical Levels

| Level | Price | Significance |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Strong Support | ₹1,280-1,300 | Key demand zone; 52-week support |
| Current Support | ₹1,350-1,370 | Immediate floor (near CMP) |
| Your Avg Buy | ₹1,451 | Overhead resistance / break-even |
| Key Resistance | ₹1,500-1,520 | Prior consolidation zone |
| Upper Target | ₹1,600-1,650 | Bull case (12-18M if Lloyd recovers) |
| 52W High | ~₹1,780 | (FY25 peak, Aug-Sep 2025) |
| 52W Low | ~₹1,280 | (Jan 2026 low) |

**Current trend:** In a downtrend from 52-week high of ₹1,780 → current ₹1,379 = 22.5% decline. Q3 results (profit miss vs estimates) triggered 7% single-day drop. No strong reversal signal yet.

## 10. Recommendation

**HOLD — Do NOT Add at current price. Set stop-loss.**

### Rationale
- Havells is a fundamentally excellent business (wide moat, strong brand, dominant distribution)
- BUT at 58x P/E with near-flat FY26 growth, the valuation is stretched and does not offer margin of safety
- Lloyd AC profitability thesis is under execution stress — Q3 FY26 -6.5% revenue decline is a red flag
- 9M FY26 PAT growth of 3.85% vs 20%+ priced-in growth expectations = valuation re-rating risk
- Your position is already underwater (-4.9%) — averaging down here would increase exposure to a high-P/E stock with slowing growth

### Action Plan

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Holds ₹1,350-1,450 range | HOLD. Do not add. Set stop-loss at ₹1,280 |
| Drops to ₹1,280-1,300 | CONSIDER small add (10-15 shares, ~₹20,000) if Q4 FY26 guidance is positive |
| Drops below ₹1,250 | REVIEW THESIS — may trigger stop-loss exit |
| Rises to ₹1,500-1,520 | EXIT at break-even or small profit. Reallocate to Polycab (better margins, lower P/E) |
| Rises to ₹1,600+ | SELL ALL. Reinvest elsewhere. P/E would be ~67x with flat growth |

### ⚠️ Stop-Loss Recommendation
Set a GTT stop-loss at **₹1,280 (trigger) → ₹1,272 (limit)** for all 42 shares.
No existing stop-loss GTT found in your account for HAVELLS.

| Q3 FY26 Rev Growth | +10.6% | +14.3% | Havells (cables-driven) |
| Valuation (P/E TTM) | ~47x | ~58x | V-Guard (cheaper) |
| Recent Growth Momentum | Underlying +22% | 9M only +4.9% | V-Guard |
| Moat Strength | Narrow | Wide | Havells |
| Lloyd Risk | None | Significant | V-Guard |
| Commodity Exposure | Moderate | High (Cables 32%) | V-Guard |
| Current Position P&L | +4.3% | -4.9% | V-Guard |
| Recommended Action | HOLD/ACCUMULATE DIPS | HOLD/SET STOP-LOSS | — |

**Overall:** V-Guard is cheaper, growing faster (underlying), lower risk, and your position is profitable. Havells is a superior business by moat quality, but current valuation makes it a riskier hold given execution headwinds.
