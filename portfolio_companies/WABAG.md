### Key Concerns

### Sector Outlook - STRUCTURAL GROWTH

- Government focus: Jal Jeevan Mission, Namami Gange
- Industrial demand rising (refineries, petrochemicals)
- Middle East desalination opportunities

### Decision Rationale
**ACCUMULATE (Strong Conviction) because:**
- Order book = revenue visibility for years
- Analyst consensus: 83-89% upside
- Sector tailwinds structural (not cyclical)
- Small 4.38% loss = easy recovery
- Recent order wins momentum strong

**Why Not Just HOLD:**
- Fundamentals too strong to ignore
- Valuation attractive vs growth
- Risk/reward heavily favors upside
