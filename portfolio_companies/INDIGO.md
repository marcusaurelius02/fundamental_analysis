- **Avg Price:** ₹4,726.46
- **Current:** ₹4,875.00
- **P&L:** +₹3,268 (+3.14%)
- **Investment:** ₹1,03,982

### Market Data
- Open: ₹4,835.15 | High: ₹4,882.85 | Low: ₹4,782.45
- Day Change: -₹88.90 (-1.79%)
- Volume: 38,133

### Q3 FY26 Results
**Revenue:** ₹245 billion (+6.7% YoY) - Modest growth
**Profit:** ₹550 Cr (-77% YoY from ₹2,449 Cr) ⚠️⚠️
**Exceptional Charges:** ₹15.5 billion total
- December disruption: ₹5.8 billion (2,500+ cancellations)
- Forex losses: ₹10.4 billion (rupee depreciation)
- Labor reform: ₹9.7 billion (one-time)

### Key Strengths
1. ✅ Market leader - India's largest airline
2. ✅ Fleet: 440 aircraft (+57 in 2025)
3. ✅ Most exceptional charges are one-time
4. ✅ Core revenue still grew 6.7%
5. ✅ Long-term Indian aviation growth story

### Key Concerns
1. ⚠️ Forex exposure ongoing (aircraft leases in USD)
2. ⚠️ Operational vulnerabilities (December chaos)
3. ⚠️ 77% profit decline (even excluding one-time, concerning)
4. ⚠️ Weak revenue growth (6.7% for peak season)

### Decision Rationale
**HOLD (not SELL) because:**
- Exceptional charges mostly one-time
- Fleet expansion supports long-term growth
- Small profit cushion (3.14%)
- Indian aviation sector growth intact

**NOT ACCUMULATE because:**
- Forex risk ongoing (structural, not one-time)
- Operational issues exposed
- Need Q4 to confirm recovery

**Trailing Stop:** ₹4,500 protects near breakeven

### Action Taken
- ✅ GTT Stop-Loss: 22 shares @ ₹4,500 (Trigger ID: 305631403)

### Price Targets
- 3M: ₹5,000-5,100 | 6M: ₹5,200-5,400 | 12M: ₹5,500-5,800

### Next Review
- **April 15-30, 2026:** Q4 FY26 results
- **Watch:** Forex losses trend (should reduce if rupee stabilizes)
- **Watch:** Operational efficiency (no repeat disruptions)
- **Decision:** If Q4 profit >₹1,500 Cr (ex-exceptional), UPGRADE
- **Exit:** If forex losses continue >₹8B or margins deteriorate

### Key Difference from Mankind
- IndiGo: Operational/exceptional issues (temporary)
- Mankind: Valuation trap (structural)
