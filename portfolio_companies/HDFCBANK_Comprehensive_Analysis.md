## 1. Business Overview

HDFC Bank (founded 1994) is India's **largest private sector bank** and #2 overall (after SBI) by assets and market cap. On July 1, 2023, it completed India's largest-ever corporate merger, absorbing its parent HDFC Ltd (housing finance). This merger created a universal banking powerhouse but triggered a 2-year post-merger recalibration that explains the stock's underperformance (₹1,750 → ₹930) despite strong underlying business fundamentals.

### Business Segments

| Segment | Revenue Contribution | Key Metric |
|---------|---------------------|-----------|
| Retail Banking | ~55% | CASA ratio 38.18%, personal loans, home loans |
| Wholesale / Corporate | ~25% | SME 17.2% growth in Q3 FY26 |
| Treasury | ~10% | Bond portfolio, forex, derivatives |
| Other Banking | ~10% | Cards, insurance distribution, fees |

### Scale & Network (as of Q3 FY26)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Branches | 9,455 (across 4,150+ cities) |
| ATMs | 21,139 |
| Advances | ₹28.45 lakh crore |
| Deposits | ₹28.60 lakh crore |
| Market share (private sector advances) | ~37% |
| Market share (overall banking advances) | ~15% |

## 2. The Post-Merger Transition — Key Context

**This is the single most important thing to understand about HDFC Bank right now.**

### The Problem (July 2023 – Present)
When HDFC Ltd merged into HDFC Bank, it brought:
- ₹5+ lakh crore of housing loans (assets)
- But these were largely funded by market borrowings (NCDs, ECBs) — NOT by low-cost deposits
- This spiked the Credit-Deposit (CD) ratio to **~110%** post-merger (ideal: <85%)
- High CD ratio = NIM compression + regulatory scrutiny

### Management's Response
| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Slow loan growth | FY25 advances grew only 5.4%; now back to 11.9% (Q3 FY26) |
| Aggressively grow deposits | Deposits grew 16.4% YoY in FY25 — outpaced loans |
| Retire high-cost HDFC Ltd borrowings | Ongoing; each maturing NCD replaced with cheaper deposits |

### Progress Report
| Metric | Post-Merger Peak | Q3 FY26 | Target (FY27) |
|--------|-----------------|---------|--------------|
| CD Ratio | ~110% | 98.5% | <90% |
| NIM | 4.1% (pre-merger) | 3.35% | ~3.7% |
| Advances Growth | 5.4% (FY25) | +11.9% (Q3 FY26) | Market rate |

**The transition is ~65-70% complete. NIM and CD ratio headwinds will persist through FY26 but should resolve by FY27.**

## 3. Financial Performance (5-Year History)

### Revenue & Profit Trend

| Year | NII (₹ cr) | PAT (₹ cr) | NIM | GNPA | Net Margin |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----|------|-----------|
| FY21 | 69,305 | 31,117 | 4.1% | 1.32% | ~18% |
| FY22 | 80,769 | 36,961 | 4.0% | 1.17% | ~19% |
| FY23 | 1,04,215 | 44,109 | 4.1% | 1.12% | ~20% |
| FY24 | 1,10,646 | 60,812 | 3.6% | 1.24% | ~20% |
| FY25 | 1,52,473 | 70,793 | 3.9% | 1.33% | ~19% |

**5-Year NII CAGR: 21.8% | 5-Year PAT CAGR: 22.1%**

*Note: FY24-25 NII/PAT jump partly due to HDFC Ltd consolidation (post-merger)*

### Q3 FY26 Snapshot (Most Recent)

| Metric | Q3 FY26 | Q3 FY25 | YoY |
|--------|---------|---------|-----|
| NII | ₹32,620 cr | ₹30,650 cr | +6.4% |
| Revenue | ₹45,870 cr | ₹42,110 cr | +8.9% |
| PAT | ₹18,654 cr | ₹16,736 cr | +11.5% |
| Advances | ₹28.45 L cr | ₹25.43 L cr | +11.9% ✅ |
| Deposits | ₹28.60 L cr | ₹25.66 L cr | +11.5% ✅ |
| GNPA | 1.24% | 1.42% | -18 bps ✅ |
| NNPA | 0.42% | 0.46% | -4 bps ✅ |
| NIM | 3.35% | 3.40% | -5 bps |

**Positives:** Double-digit loan growth resumed for first time post-merger, asset quality improving, deposits and advances growing in tandem.
**Negative:** NIM still compressing (3.35% vs 4.1% pre-merger), will stabilize only in FY27.

## 5. Moat Analysis

| Moat Type | Rating (1-5) | Evidence |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Brand & Trust | 5/5 | India's most trusted private bank; #1 in customer service rankings consistently |
| Distribution Network | 5/5 | 9,455 branches, deepest private bank network; 4,150+ cities; near-impossible to replicate |
| CASA Franchise | 4/5 | 38.18% CASA — lower-cost funding vs competitors; built over 30 years |
| Switching Costs | 4/5 | Salary accounts, auto-debits, home loans, cards — high stickiness once a primary banker |
| Scale Advantage | 5/5 | 37% of private sector advances — pricing power, spreads, operating leverage |
| Technology | 4/5 | PayZapp, SmartHub, NetBanking platform; heavy tech investment (₹15,000+ cr/year) |
| Regulatory Position | 4/5 | D-SIB (Domestic Systemically Important Bank) — too big to fail; implicit sovereign backing |

**Overall Moat: WIDE** — One of the widest moats in Indian financial services. Scale + distribution + brand + CASA franchise = durable competitive advantage compounding over decades.

## 6. Management Quality

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| CEO | Sashidhar Jagdishan (since Oct 2020). Deep HDFC Bank lifer (1996). Execution-focused. |
| Merger execution | Complex ₹60,000 cr merger handled without major disruptions — competent |
| Capital allocation | Conservative provisioning, high CAR (19.6%), consistent dividend (₹22/share FY25) |
| Guidance credibility | Transparent about CD ratio timeline (FY27 target). No overpromising. |
| Promoter | No promoter (institutional ownership). RBI-regulated. Strong governance. |
| Red flags | None significant. Some frustration from analysts on NIM timeline delays, but manageable. |

**Management Quality: HIGH** — One of the best-managed banks in India. Track record of 30 years of consistent execution.

## 7. Competitive Position vs Peers

| Bank | Advances | NIM | GNPA | P/E | P/B | ROE | Moat |
|------|---------|-----|------|-----|-----|-----|------|
| **HDFC Bank** | ₹28.45 L cr | 3.35% | 1.24% | 19.5x | 2.65x | ~16% | Wide |
| ICICI Bank | ₹14+ L cr | 3.79% | ~2.3% | 20.1x | 3.18x | ~19% | Wide |
| Kotak Mahindra | ₹4.5 L cr | 4.9% | ~1.5% | 31.7x | 2.54x | ~14% | Wide |
| Axis Bank | ₹9.5 L cr | 3.8% | ~1.5% | ~15x | 1.9x | ~17% | Moderate |
| SBI | ₹39 L cr | 3.2% | 2.0% | ~11x | 1.8x | ~19% | Wide (PSU) |

**Key insight:** HDFC Bank is the CHEAPEST of the top 3 private banks on P/E (19.5x vs ICICI 20.1x, Kotak 31.7x) despite:
- Superior asset quality (lowest GNPA among large private banks)
- Widest branch network
- Strongest CASA franchise

**The discount is entirely due to the post-merger NIM compression — a temporary, transitional issue.**

## 8. Growth Drivers & Risks

### Growth Drivers
1. **NIM recovery:** 3.35% → 3.7% target by FY27. Every 10 bps NIM improvement = ~₹3,000 cr additional annual PAT. This is the single biggest re-rating trigger.
2. **Loan growth acceleration:** FY25 was deliberately slow (5.4%). Q3 FY26 already at 11.9%. FY27 management guided "faster than system" (system growing ~12-13% = HDFC Bank at 14-16%).
3. **CD ratio normalization:** <90% target by FY27 unlocks ability to grow loans without deposit constraints.
4. **HDFC Ltd home loan book:** ₹7+ lakh crore home loan book (acquired via merger) repricing gradually to bank deposits = massive NIM tailwind over next 2-3 years.
5. **Fee income growth:** Cards, insurance, wealth management — structural growth in non-interest income.
6. **Rural/semi-urban expansion:** 9,455 branches growing toward 10,000+; deeper penetration of under-banked markets.

### Risks
1. **NIM takes longer to recover:** If RBI cuts rates faster than expected, deposit rates fall but so do lending rates — NIM benefit may be smaller/delayed.
2. **Credit quality:** GNPA 1.24% is excellent, but rural/MSME stress could tick up if macro slows. Watch Q4 FY26.
3. **Regulatory risk:** RBI restrictions on credit card sourcing (faced in late 2023) — any new regulatory action could impact growth.
4. **Competition from ICICI/Kotak:** Both gaining market share aggressively in retail and SME.
5. **Attrition in talent:** Post-merger, some key executives departed. Managing culture across 1.8 lakh+ employees at scale is a risk.

## 9. Valuation

### Why is HDFC Bank at Historical Low Valuations?

| Period | P/B Multiple | Reason |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| FY18-22 (peak) | 3.8-5.0x | Premium growth franchise, NIM ~4.1% |
| FY23 | 3.5x | Pre-merger uncertainty |
| FY24 | 2.9x | Post-merger NIM compression |
| Feb 2026 | **2.65x** | CD ratio + NIM headwinds priced in |

**HDFC Bank is at a 10-year valuation low on P/B.** The market is pricing in permanent impairment, but management is guiding for full NIM recovery by FY27. This is the core investment thesis.

### Intrinsic Value Calculation

**Book Value per Share (BVPS):** CMP ₹932.75 / P/B 2.65x = ₹351.8 per share

| Scenario | P/B Multiple | Rationale | Target Price |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Bear | 2.5x | NIM recovery delayed to FY28, flat growth | ₹880 |
| Base | 3.2x | NIM recovers to 3.6% by FY27, 12-14% loan CAGR | **₹1,125** |
| Bull | 3.8x | Full NIM recovery to 3.9%, re-rating to pre-merger levels | **₹1,335** |

**P/E Based Valuation:**
- FY26E PAT: ~₹75,000 cr (₹18,654 cr × 4 = ₹74,616 cr annualised)
- FY27E PAT: ~₹88,000 cr (NIM recovery + loan growth)
- At P/E 22x (FY27E): ₹88,000 cr × 22x / shares = **₹1,100-1,200**

**Fair Value Range: ₹1,050 – ₹1,250**
**Current CMP: ₹932.75 → 12-34% upside to fair value range**

## 10. Your Position Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Your avg buy | ₹786.16 |
| CMP | ₹932.75 |
| Unrealised gain | +₹1,30,739 (+18.6%) |
| Current value | ₹8,30,148 |
| 52-week range | ₹1,150 (high) → ₹900 (low approx) |
| Distance from 52W high | -19% |

**You bought at an excellent price.** ₹786 was near the post-merger bottom. The stock is recovering (+18.6%) but still well below its fair value.

### Active GTTs Review

| GTT | Type | Trigger | Action | Assessment |
|-----|------|---------|--------|-----------|
| BUY 10 shares @ ₹900 | Single | ₹900 | BUY 10 | ✅ Good — adds on dip, only 3.5% below CMP, may fire on any minor correction |
| SELL 406 @ ₹845 (stop) | Two-leg lower | ₹845 | SELL 406 | ⚠️ Stop-loss is 9.4% below CMP. Covers 45% of your position |
| SELL 200 @ ₹1,100 (target) | Two-leg upper | ₹1,100 | SELL 200 | ✅ Profit target 17.9% above CMP. Reasonable partial exit |

## 11. Technical Levels

| Level | Price | Significance |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Strong Support | ₹880-900 | Post-merger low zone; BUY GTT at ₹900 will add |
| Current Support | ₹920-930 | Immediate floor (near CMP) |
| Your Avg Buy | ₹786 | Deep support / cost basis |
| Key Resistance | ₹960-980 | Near-term supply zone |
| Target 1 | ₹1,050-1,100 | Base case fair value (12-18M) |
| Target 2 | ₹1,200-1,300 | Bull case (FY27 NIM recovery) |
| Sell GTT | ₹1,100 | Partial exit (200 shares) already set |

---

## 12. Recommendation

**HOLD + ACCUMULATE ON DIPS**

### Rationale
1. **Widest moat in Indian banking** — no private bank can replicate the branch network, CASA franchise, or brand in <10 years
2. **Trading at 10-year low valuations** — P/B 2.65x vs historical 3.5-4.5x. The discount is temporary (post-merger NIM compression), not structural
3. **NIM recovery catalyst is near** — Q4 FY26 and FY27 will show NIM improvement as high-cost HDFC Ltd borrowings roll off. Each 10 bps recovery = ₹3,000 cr PAT upside
4. **Loan growth resuming** — 11.9% in Q3 FY26 (first double-digit post-merger). FY27 guided "faster than system"
5. **Your position is at an excellent avg** (₹786) — already +18.6% and at a strong margin of safety
6. **Largest holding deserves active monitoring** — ₹8.3L position, no formal analysis existed until now

### Action Plan

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Dips to ₹880-900 | BUY GTT fires (10 shares). Consider adding another 20-30 shares manually (~₹20,000-28,000) |
| Holds ₹920-960 | HOLD. No action needed |
| Rises to ₹1,050-1,100 | Reassess partial exit. SELL GTT at ₹1,100 (200 shares) is reasonable — let it stand |
| Rises to ₹1,200+ | Review selling another 100-150 shares (total partial exit ~30-35%) |
| Falls below ₹845 | SELL GTT fires (406 shares stop-loss). Protects core gains |

**Do NOT sell aggressively at current price.** The NIM recovery thesis has 12-18 months to play out. This is a core blue-chip holding.

**Key Monitorables (Quarterly)**
1. **NIM trend:** Must show improvement from 3.35% toward 3.5%+ in H1 FY27
2. **CD ratio:** Heading toward <90% by FY27 — track quarterly
3. **Loan growth:** Sustain 12-15% YoY — recovery trend intact
4. **GNPA:** Must stay below 1.5% — any spike = red flag
5. **Deposit growth vs advances growth:** Deposits must keep pace with loans

**Next catalyst:** Q4 FY26 results (April 2026) — watch for NIM guidance and CD ratio trajectory.
