### Market Data

### Q3 FY26 Results

**Profit:** ₹133 Cr (-29% YoY from ₹187 Cr) ⚠️
- One-time labor provision: ₹60 Cr
- Excluding provision: Still down 3.5%
**Margins:** EBIT 15.6% (down from 17.2% YoY) - 160 bps decline ⚠️
**Dividend:** ₹2.25/share

### Key Strengths
1. ✅ 22 consecutive growth quarters (5+ years)
2. ✅ Intrinsic value ₹1,235 vs ₹967 current (28% undervalued)
3. ✅ Analyst target ₹1,341 (39% upside)
4. ✅ Strong ROE: 23.79%
5. ✅ Structural tailwinds: SDV, AI mobility, autonomous driving

### Key Concerns
1. ⚠️ Margin compression (15.6% vs 17.2%) for multiple quarters
2. ⚠️ Employee costs rising faster than revenue
3. ⚠️ Heavy European client concentration (60%+)
4. ⚠️ P/E 43.82x (high vs IT peers at 30-35x)

### Decision Rationale
**HOLD because:**
- Stock corrected 16%, now undervalued (intrinsic ₹1,235)
- 22 growth quarters = strong execution
- Sector tailwinds structural (not cyclical)
- Analyst support with 39% upside

**NOT ACCUMULATE because:**
- Margin compression red flag (per investment criteria)
- Need Q4 to confirm if pressure temporary

**Stop-Loss:** ₹900 protects against 7% further downside

### Action Taken

### Price Targets

### Next Review
- **April-May 2026:** Q4 FY26 results - CRITICAL
- **Watch:** EBIT margin must be >16.5%
- **Decision:** If margins recover, UPGRADE to ACCUMULATE
- **Exit:** If margins <15% in Q4 (3+ quarters decline = structural)
