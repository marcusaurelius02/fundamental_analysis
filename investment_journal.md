### 2026-02-05 | KPIT TECHNOLOGIES | HOLD + STOP-LOSS

**Position:** 110 shares @ ₹1,151.10 avg | Current: ₹967.40 | Loss: -15.96% (₹20,207)

**Decision:** HOLD with stop-loss at ₹900 (biggest portfolio loss, needs monitoring)

**Rationale:** KPIT reported 22nd consecutive growth quarter with Q3 revenue up 9.5% but profit crashed 29% (₹133 Cr from ₹187 Cr) due to ₹60 Cr labor provision and margin compression (EBIT 15.6% vs 17.2% YoY). Excluding provision, profit still down 3.5%. Margin pressure is red flag but intrinsic value ₹1,235 vs current ₹967 shows 28% undervaluation. Multiple analysts target ₹1,341 (39% upside). Strong ROE 23.79% and structural sector tailwinds (software-defined vehicles, AI-infused mobility, autonomous driving) support long-term case. Stock corrected 16% from buy price - not a valuation trap but margin recovery critical. Hold with protection until Q4 confirms if margin pressure temporary or structural.

**Action Taken:**
- ✅ GTT stop-loss: 110 shares at ₹900 (Trigger ID: 305672287)
- 📊 Monitoring: Q3 results analysis, margin trends, automotive sector, European market health

**Follow-Up Schedule:**
- 📅 **February 2026**: Monitor ₹900 support level, watch automotive sector news
- 📅 **April-May 2026**: Q4 FY26 results - CRITICAL check for EBIT margin recovery (must be >16.5%)
- 📅 **July 2026**: Q1 FY27 results - Confirm margin trend direction (if >16%, upgrade; if <15%, exit)
- 📅 **Quarterly**: Track European automotive OEM earnings, order book momentum, TCV wins
- 🎯 **Price Targets**: ₹1,050-1,100 (3M) | ₹1,150-1,200 (6M) | ₹1,250-1,341 (12M)

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ Stop-loss hit at ₹900
- ❌ Q4 EBIT margin <15% (structural decline confirmed for 3+ quarters)
- ❌ Major client loss (>15% revenue impact) or European automotive recession
- ✅ Partial exit at ₹1,100-1,150 on rally if margin concerns persist

### 2026-02-05 | VA TECH WABAG | ACCUMULATE + STOP-LOSS

**Position:** 64 shares @ ₹1,243.46 avg | Current: ₹1,189 | Loss: -4.38% (₹3,485)

**Decision:** ACCUMULATE - Buy 20 more shares at ₹1,150 + GTT stop-loss at ₹1,000

**Rationale:** VA Tech Wabag shows strong fundamentals with ₹16,000 Cr order book providing 3.3x EPC and 8.6x O&M revenue visibility. Recent order wins include ₹3,251 Cr Saudi desalination project and ₹600 Cr BPCL contract. Q2 FY26 showed 19% revenue growth and 21% profit growth. Multiple analysts (B&K Securities, Systematix) initiated BUY ratings with 83-89% upside potential, projecting 15.7% revenue CAGR and 23% earnings CAGR (FY25-28E) with margin expansion to 14.6%. Water infrastructure sector has structural tailwinds (rising water stress, low wastewater treatment capacity). Current 4.38% loss presents accumulation opportunity given massive order book visibility and positive sector outlook.

**Action Taken:**
- ✅ GTT BUY order: 20 shares at ₹1,150 (Trigger ID: 305665451)
- ✅ GTT stop-loss: 64 shares at ₹1,000 (Trigger ID: 305665456)
- 📊 Monitoring: Q3 results (Feb 5), order book additions, margin trends, working capital

**Follow-Up Schedule:**
- 📅 **Feb 5-10, 2026**: Q3 FY26 results - Watch revenue growth (>15%), margins (>13%), new orders
- 📅 **After Buy Executes**: Update stop-loss from 64 to 84 shares at ₹1,000 (cancel old GTT, place new)
- 📅 **May 2026**: Q4 FY26 results - Full year performance and FY27 guidance
- 📅 **Quarterly**: Order book updates, new wins, execution pace
- 🎯 **Price Targets**: ₹1,350-1,400 (6M) | ₹1,500-1,600 (12M) | ₹1,800-2,000 (18-24M)

**Position After Buy Executes:**
- Total Shares: 84 (64 current + 20 new)
- New Average: ~₹1,230 (improved from ₹1,243)
- Total Investment: ~₹1,03,500

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ Stop-loss hit at ₹1,000 (protect capital)
- ❌ Order book growth slows significantly or major cancellations
- ❌ Margins compress below 12% for 2 consecutive quarters
- ✅ Partial exit (30-40%) at ₹1,500 to book profit and reduce risk
- ✅ Trail stop-loss upward as stock appreciates

### 2026-02-05 | INDIGO | HOLD + TRAILING STOP-LOSS

**Position:** 22 shares @ ₹4,726.46 avg | Current: ₹4,875 | Gain: +3.14% (₹3,268)

**Decision:** HOLD with trailing stop-loss at ₹4,500 (breakeven protection)

**Rationale:** IndiGo's Q3 profit collapsed 77% to ₹550 Cr due to ₹15.5 billion exceptional charges (December operational chaos costing ₹5.8B, forex losses of ₹10.4B, and labor reform charges of ₹9.7B). However, core revenue grew 6.7% and most charges are one-time/non-recurring. Fleet expansion continues aggressively (440 aircraft, +57 in 2025) supporting long-term growth. Unlike Mankind's valuation trap, IndiGo's issues are operational/exceptional. Key risks: ongoing forex exposure with rupee volatility and operational efficiency. Stop-loss at ₹4,500 protects near breakeven while allowing recovery if Q4 shows clean profitability without exceptional items.

**Action Taken:**
- ✅ GTT stop-loss order placed at ₹4,500 (Trigger ID: 305631403)
- 📊 Monitoring: Forex losses trend, operational efficiency, load factor, ex-exceptional profitability

**Follow-Up Schedule:**
- 📅 **April 15-30, 2026**: Q4 FY26 results - Check for forex loss continuation and operational improvements
- 📅 **July 2026**: Q1 FY27 results - Assess if profitability normalizes post-exceptional items
- 📅 **Monthly**: Track USD/INR forex trends (impacts aircraft lease costs)
- 🎯 **Price Alerts**: ₹5,200 (reassess upside potential) | ₹4,500 (stop-loss trigger)

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ Stop-loss hit at ₹4,500
- ❌ Q4 shows continued forex losses >₹8B or operational margins deteriorate
- ✅ Upgrade to accumulate if Q4 profit >₹1,500 Cr (ex-exceptional items)

### 2026-02-05 | MANKIND PHARMA | HOLD + STOP-LOSS

**Position:** 100 shares @ ₹2,290.33 avg | Current: ₹2,085 | Loss: -8.96% (₹20,533)

**Decision:** HOLD with strict monitoring + GTT stop-loss at ₹1,950 (-15%)

**Rationale:** Mankind Pharma reported mixed Q3 results with revenue growth of 11.5% but concerning EBITDA margin compression from 25.6% to 22.9%. The stock trades at a premium valuation of 45x P/E versus pharma peers (Sun: 30x, Cipla: 28x, Dr. Reddy's: 35x), raising valuation trap concerns. While revenue growth remains healthy and analyst targets suggest 18% upside to ₹2,460, the margin pressure needs resolution. Key watch points: Q4 margin recovery and peer performance. Stop-loss protects against further downside if fundamentals deteriorate. Will reassess if margins don't stabilize by Q1 FY27.

**Action Taken:**
- ✅ GTT stop-loss order placed at ₹1,950 (Trigger ID: 305578263)
- 📊 Monitoring: EBITDA margins, P/E compression, Q4 results, peer comparison

**Follow-Up Schedule:**
- 📅 **April-May 2026**: Q4 FY26 results - Critical check for EBITDA margin recovery (target: >24%)
- 📅 **July 2026**: Q1 FY27 results - Assess if margin compression trend reverses
- 📅 **Monthly**: Compare P/E with pharma peers (Sun, Cipla, Dr. Reddy's) for valuation gap
- 🎯 **Price Alerts**: ₹2,200 (reassess exit on bounce) | ₹2,460 (analyst target, book profit) | ₹1,950 (stop-loss trigger)

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ Stop-loss hit at ₹1,950
- ❌ EBITDA margins stay below 24% for 2 consecutive quarters
- ❌ P/E remains >40x while peers trade at <35x with better margins
- ✅ Partial exit at ₹2,200-2,300 range to reduce risk exposure
