### 2026-02-12 | HCLTECH | EXIT (STOP-LOSS TRIGGERED)

**Position:** 24 shares @ ₹1,543.42 avg | Sold: ₹1,500.00 | Loss: -₹1,042 (-2.8%)

**Decision:** EXIT — GTT two-leg stop-loss triggered automatically at market open.

**Rationale:** HCL Tech dropped 4.55% on Feb 12 as part of a broad IT sector selloff triggered by Anthropic's Claude Cowork plugin release, which intensified fears of AI disrupting traditional IT services. Nifty IT index down 10% YTD. The two-leg GTT (ID: 302218664) had a lower trigger at ₹1,500 which fired at 9:23 AM. Stock fell to ₹1,480 intraday — stop-loss saved further downside. IT services face structural headwinds from AI replacing consulting, data analytics, and software development work traditionally outsourced to Indian IT companies. Exit was well-timed.

**Action Taken:**
- ✅ GTT stop-loss fired: 24 shares sold at ₹1,500 (Trigger ID: **302218664**, Order ID: 2021794559717056515)
- 💰 Cash recovered: ₹36,000
- 📊 Realized loss: -₹1,042

**Post-Exit Notes:**
- No position remaining in HCLTECH
- IT sector structural concern (AI disruption) — avoid re-entry unless clear evidence of business model adaptation
- Cash redeployed to portfolio dry powder

### 2026-02-12 | KPITTECH | EXIT (STOP-LOSS TRIGGERED)

**Position:** 83 shares @ ₹1,131.56 avg | Sold: ₹900.10 | Loss: -₹19,211 (-20.4%)

**Decision:** EXIT — GTT stop-loss triggered as IT selloff intensified.

**Rationale:** KPIT Technologies dropped 4.98% on Feb 12 in the same IT sector selloff. Although KPIT does automotive software (SDV/EV/autonomous driving) — not traditional IT outsourcing — it was dragged down by sector-wide selling. The stock had been weak since Q3 results showed profit crash of 29% (₹133 Cr from ₹187 Cr) due to ₹60 Cr labor provision and margin compression (EBIT 15.6% vs 17.2% YoY). Original journal entry (Feb 5) set stop-loss at ₹900 contingent on Q4 margin recovery. GTT was corrected from 110→83 shares earlier today (quantity mismatch fix), and fired correctly at 11:20 AM. Biggest single-stock realized loss in portfolio. Margin recovery thesis did not get a chance to play out — stock broke support before Q4 results.

**Action Taken:**
- ✅ GTT stop-loss fired: 83 shares sold at ₹900.10 avg (Trigger ID: **305672287**, Order ID: 2021824203283537921)
- 💰 Cash recovered: ₹74,708
- 📊 Realized loss: -₹19,211

**Post-Exit Notes:**
- No position remaining in KPITTECH
- KPIT's automotive software business (SDV, EV) has structural tailwinds — but margin compression + IT sector sentiment = wrong time to hold
- **Re-entry consideration:** If KPIT reports Q4 FY26 EBIT margin >16.5% (April-May 2026) AND stock is below ₹950, reconsider. Intrinsic value was estimated at ₹1,235.
- Budget 2026 supports EV localization — long-term positive for KPIT's addressable market

### 2026-02-12 | TCS | EXIT (MANUAL SELL)

**Position:** 10 shares @ ₹3,084.93 avg | Sold: ₹2,756.00 | Loss: -₹3,289 (-10.7%)

**Decision:** EXIT — Manual sell decision amid IT sector structural concerns.

**Rationale:** TCS dropped 4.13% on Feb 12 as part of the broad IT selloff. ₹1,00,000 crore wiped from top 5 IT stocks in a single day. SBI overtook TCS as India's 4th largest company by market cap — symbolic of the sector's decline. Small position (10 shares, ₹28K) with no documented thesis or stop-loss in journal — was legacy holding without active management. AI disruption threatens traditional IT outsourcing model (TCS derives majority revenue from application development, maintenance, and consulting — all areas where AI coding assistants are gaining traction). Rather than hold through further structural decline, exited at ₹2,756 to redeploy capital into sectors with clearer growth visibility.

**Action Taken:**
- ✅ Manual sell: 10 shares at ₹2,756 (Order ID: 2021874717757054976)
- 💰 Cash recovered: ₹27,560
- 📊 Realized loss: -₹3,289

**Post-Exit Notes:**
- No position remaining in TCS
- Avoid traditional IT services (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL) until AI disruption impact becomes clearer
- Total IT sector exits today: HCLTECH + KPITTECH + TCS = -₹23,542 realized loss, ₹1,38,268 cash recovered

### 2026-02-12 | PORTFOLIO NOTE | IT SECTOR COMPLETE EXIT

**Summary:** Exited all three IT holdings in a single day due to structural AI disruption concerns.

| Stock | Shares | Sell Price | Avg Cost | Realized P&L | Method |
|-------|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| HCLTECH | 24 | ₹1,500.00 | ₹1,543.42 | -₹1,042 | GTT stop-loss |
| KPITTECH | 83 | ₹900.10 | ₹1,131.56 | -₹19,211 | GTT stop-loss |
| TCS | 10 | ₹2,756.00 | ₹3,084.93 | -₹3,289 | Manual sell |
| **Total** | | | | **-₹23,542** | **₹1,38,268 cash** |

**Thesis:** AI tools (Anthropic Claude Cowork, GitHub Copilot, etc.) are accelerating displacement of traditional IT services work. Nifty IT -10% YTD. Indian IT companies face long-term revenue growth headwinds as clients adopt AI for coding, testing, consulting, and data analytics. Portfolio is now zero-weight IT services — cash redeployed to sectors with structural tailwinds.

**Available cash post-exits:** ~₹5.8L (₹4.4L existing + ₹1.38L from exits)

**Re-entry criteria for IT sector:**
- Evidence of successful AI-integrated business models (revenue from AI services > revenue lost from traditional services)
- Margin stabilization post-AI transition (EBIT >18% sustained)
- Valuation reset to P/E <20x for large-caps

### 2026-02-10 | GODREJPROP | HOLD + ACCUMULATE ON DIPS (GTT BUY ORDERS SET)

**Position:** 15 shares @ ₹1,501.67 avg | Current: ₹1,818 | Gain: +₹4,746 (+21.1%)

**Decision:** HOLD existing 15 shares. Accumulate on dips via two GTT BUY orders at ₹1,650 and ₹1,500. Do not chase above ₹1,850.

**Rationale:** Full analysis updated (see `portfolio_companies/Godrej_Properties_Analysis_Feb2025.md`). Original Feb 2025 BUY thesis has validated strongly — FY25 PAT +93% to ₹1,400 cr, presales +31% to ₹29,444 cr (beat guidance), OCF ₹7,484 cr (FCF concern from original analysis improving materially). Q3 FY26 bookings ₹8,421 cr (+55% YoY, record quarter), 9M bookings ₹24,008 cr (74% of FY26 guidance with one quarter left — on track to beat). Business compounding well but stock near fair value at ₹1,818 (P/E ~30x FY26E). No urgency to buy at current levels; better risk-reward on dips. Position too small at ₹27k vs ₹40-50k mid-cap sizing guideline — GTTs will build it to ~₹55k if both fire. Analyst consensus target ₹2,548 (+40% upside) from 22 analysts.

**Action Taken:**
- ✅ HOLD all 15 shares (original position in profit, thesis intact)
- ✅ GTT BUY #1: 10 shares @ trigger ₹1,650 → limit ₹1,658 (Trigger ID: **306254383**)
- ✅ GTT BUY #2: 10 shares @ trigger ₹1,500 → limit ₹1,508 (Trigger ID: **306254397**)
- 📊 If both GTTs fire: 35 total shares, blended avg ~₹1,560, total deployed ~₹54,600

**Follow-Up Schedule:**
- 📅 **April-May 2026**: Q4 FY26 results — target bookings >₹8,000 cr (to meet ₹32,500 cr FY26 guidance), OCF >₹8,000 cr full year
- 📅 **Monitor**: If price dips to ₹1,650 or ₹1,500, GTTs fire automatically
- 📅 **Quarterly**: Track collections/bookings ratio (target >55%), net debt levels post land acquisitions

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ Rises to ₹2,200+: Consider partial profit booking (sell 7-8 shares)
- ✅ Rises to ₹2,500+ (analyst target): Sell 50%, hold rest with trailing stop
- ❌ Bookings drop below ₹6,000 cr/qtr for 2 consecutive quarters: Thesis weakening, review
- ❌ Net debt/equity crosses 0.5x: Land acquisition aggression becoming a risk
- ✅ Breaks ₹1,250 (original stop-loss from Feb 2025 analysis): EXIT all

**Key Thesis:** Godrej Properties is executing its presales growth story — bookings compounding at 25-55% YoY, OCF turning positive, pipeline visibility strong (₹30,000 cr+ BD additions in FY26). Near-term P&L will remain lumpy (real estate accounting lag), but leading indicators (bookings, collections) are strong. Accumulate on any market-driven dips; current price (₹1,818) is fair but not cheap.

### 2026-02-10 | HAVELLS | HOLD + STOP-LOSS SET

**Position:** 42 shares @ ₹1,450.73 avg | Current: ₹1,375.70 | Loss: -₹3,170 (-4.9%)

**Decision:** HOLD existing 42 shares. Do NOT add at current price. Stop-loss GTT placed to protect against further downside.

**Rationale:** Full analysis conducted (see `portfolio_companies/HAVELLS_Comprehensive_Analysis.md`). Havells is a wide-moat business (India's deepest electrical distribution network — 260,000 retailers, 301,000 electricians) but is currently trading at ~58x P/E with only 3.85% PAT growth in 9M FY26 — a dangerous combination. The Lloyd AC segment (-6.5% revenue in Q3 FY26) is the key execution risk; it was acquired in 2017 and has dragged earnings for 7 years, only recently reaching profitability. Cable segment (32% of revenue, +32.8% Q3 FY26) is masking broader weakness — lighting down 4%, ECD growing only 4.3%. 9M FY26 full-year revenue trajectory implies near-flat FY26 vs FY25. Valuation offers no margin of safety at current levels. Position is already -4.9% underwater; averaging down at 58x P/E with slowing growth would increase risk without improving risk-reward. Stop-loss set at ₹1,280 (7% further downside from CMP) to protect capital.

**Action Taken:**
- ✅ HOLD all 42 shares
- ✅ GTT stop-loss placed: SELL 42 shares @ trigger ₹1,280 → limit ₹1,272 (Trigger ID: **306227789**)
- 📊 Monitoring: Q4 FY26 results (April-May), Lloyd AC demand recovery, copper prices

**Follow-Up Schedule:**
- 📅 **Feb-Mar 2026**: Watch if price holds ₹1,350 support. Below ₹1,300 = stop-loss fires
- 📅 **April-May 2026**: Q4 FY26 results — key test. Need Lloyd revenue growth >10% and overall PAT growth >12% to justify holding
- 📅 **Summer 2026 (Apr-Jun)**: Critical for Lloyd AC — good summer = potential recovery trigger

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ Stop-loss fires at ₹1,280 — exit all 42 shares (Trigger ID: 306227789)
- ✅ Rises to ₹1,500-1,520 — exit at break-even/small profit, redeploy to better risk-reward
- ❌ Q4 FY26 shows Lloyd revenue decline + PAT growth <8% — consider early exit before stop-loss
- ✅ Rises to ₹1,600+ (bull case, Lloyd recovery) — SELL ALL, P/E would be ~67x on flat earnings

**Key Thesis:** Havells is a quality business in a valuation trap. Wide moat (distribution + brand) is intact but Lloyd integration drag + commodity exposure + rich P/E (58x) = limited upside and meaningful downside risk at current levels. Hold for potential Lloyd recovery in FY27; stop-loss protects against further deterioration.

### 2026-02-09 | HDFC AMC | HOLD + ACCUMULATE ON DIPS (BETTER THAN ICICI)

**Position:** 58 shares @ ₹2,570.22 avg | Current: ₹2,750.00 | Gain: +6.48% (₹10,427)

**Decision:** HOLD + STRONG ACCUMULATE if dips to ₹2,600-2,650. Add 20-30 shares (₹60-75k). BETTER RISK-REWARD than ICICI AMC.

**Rationale:** HDFC AMC is India's #1 AMC (₹9.25T QAAUM, 11.4% market share) with widest competitive moat (brand leadership, 28-year track record, operational excellence). Q3 FY26 showed steady performance: profit up 20% to ₹769 Cr, revenue up 15% to ₹1,075 Cr, driven by QAAUM growth 17.5% YoY. **KEY ADVANTAGES vs ICICI:** (1) SUPERIOR MARGINS - 70.4% net margin vs ICICI's 56.6% = 14% efficiency edge, (2) BETTER VALUATION - ₹2,750 vs ICICI ₹3,017 (12% cheaper) with P/B 14.6x vs 32.9x (2.3x lower), (3) LOWER RISK - Established since 2018 (proven through cycles) vs ICICI recent IPO Dec 2025 (untested), diversified distribution (75K IFAs) vs ICICI captive concentration (75% ICICI Bank), (4) REGULATORY RESILIENCE - Operates in open architecture (no disruption risk) vs ICICI's existential threat if SEBI mandates open architecture. Company debt-free, 95% FCF/PAT conversion, 75.6% dividend payout (shareholder-friendly). ROE 30.9% (strong, though lower than ICICI's leveraged 82.8%). Intrinsic value ₹2,850-3,400 vs current ₹2,750 = 4-24% undervalued. Analyst consensus ₹3,040 (range ₹2,460-6,530) implies 11% upside. **COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS (HDFC vs ICICI):** HDFC offers 11.9% weighted expected return vs ICICI 8.4%, lower volatility, better margin of safety. HDFC = core quality holding (60-70% AMC allocation), ICICI = satellite growth play (30-40%). Valuation fair to attractive: P/E 41.4x (vs ICICI 46.8x), PEG 2.07 (high but acceptable for quality). Key risks: (1) Bear market (65% equity AUM = highest exposure), (2) ICICI gaining market share (11.4% → 11.2% net flow share, slight erosion), (3) Performance cyclicality (must maintain 55%+ schemes outperformance). Unlike ICICI (high growth, high risk, rich valuation), HDFC = proven compounder, fair price, lower risk. Recommendation: HOLD existing 58 shares, ACCUMULATE aggressively on dips to ₹2,600-2,650 (strong buy zone).

**Action Taken:**
- ✅ HOLD all 58 shares (core AMC holding)
- ✅ GTT stop-loss: 58 shares at ₹2,500 (Trigger ID: 306070563)
- 📊 Monitoring: Q4 FY26 results (April), monthly QAAUM/net flows, fund performance rankings, market share trends
- 🎯 Price Alerts: Set at ₹2,600 (STRONG BUY zone) and ₹2,850 (breakout level)

**Follow-Up Schedule:**
- 📅 **Feb-Mar 2026**: Monitor for dip to ₹2,600-2,650 (STRONG ADD 20-30 shares, total ₹60-75k investment)
- 📅 **April 2026**: Q4 FY26 results - Watch QAAUM growth (target >15%), net flow market share (defend 11%+), fund performance (>55% schemes outperform), net margin (maintain >68%)
- 📅 **Monthly**: Track AMFI data - market share (must stay >11%), net equity flows (positive?), vs ICICI competitive dynamics
- 📅 **Quarterly**: Fund performance rankings - if <50% schemes outperform for 2 quarters, performance slippage risk
- 🎯 **Price Targets**: ₹2,900-3,000 (6M) | ₹3,100-3,200 (12M base case) | ₹3,500 (18-24M bull case)

**Position Strategy:**
- Current: 58 shares, ₹1,59,500 value (₹10,427 profit)
- **Accumulation Strategy (PRIORITY - Better value than ICICI):**
  - If dips to ₹2,600-2,650: STRONG ADD 20-30 shares @ ₹2,625 avg = ₹60-75k
  - New total: 78-88 shares, avg ₹2,605-2,610
  - Rationale: 12% cheaper than ICICI (₹2,750 vs ₹3,017) with 14% higher margins (70% vs 56%)
- **Comparison with ICICI:**
  - HDFC: P/E 41.4x, fair value, 11.9% expected return, LOW-MEDIUM risk
  - ICICI: P/E 46.8x, rich value, 8.4% expected return, MEDIUM-HIGH risk
  - **Winner:** HDFC on risk-adjusted basis (+3.5% higher return, lower vol)

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ Stop-loss hit at ₹2,500 (trend breakdown, protect 6.5% gains)
- ❌ Market share drops below 11% for 3 consecutive months (losing competitive edge permanently)
- ❌ Net flows negative for 3 months (redemption pressure)
- ❌ Net margin falls below 68% for 2 quarters (pricing power eroding)
- ❌ >50% of funds underperform benchmarks for 2 consecutive quarters (performance slippage)
- ❌ Major regulatory change (unlikely to impact HDFC negatively vs already operates in open architecture)
- ✅ Partial exit (20-30%) at ₹3,400+ if reached quickly (<12 months) to rebalance

**Key Thesis:** HDFC AMC = Core Quality AMC Holding (wide moat brand + scale + performance, highest margins 70%, established 28-year track record, fair valuation P/E 41.4x with 10-15% upside). **SUPERIOR TO ICICI on risk-adjusted basis:** 12% cheaper price, 14% higher margins, 2.3x lower P/B valuation, proven through cycles, no regulatory concentration risk. HDFC = steady 12-18% CAGR compounder (quality + stability), ICICI = volatile 20-25% CAGR growth story (momentum + risk). Allocate 60-70% of AMC exposure to HDFC (core), 30-40% to ICICI (satellite). Current position 58 shares appropriate, STRONG ACCUMULATE on any dip to ₹2,600-2,650 to build to 80-90 shares (₹2.2-2.5L total exposure).

### 2026-02-09 | ICICI PRUDENTIAL AMC | HOLD + CONSIDER PARTIAL PROFIT BOOKING

**Position:** 12 shares @ ₹2,635.425 avg | Current: ₹3,017.10 | Gain: +14.49% (₹4,581)

**Decision:** HOLD with trailing stop-loss at ₹2,700. Consider PARTIAL PROFIT BOOKING if rallies to ₹3,300-3,400 (sell 50% = 6 shares).

**Rationale:** ICICI Pru AMC is a wide-moat asset-light compounder with exceptional profitability (ROE 82.8%, ROCE 111%, net margins 60%+) and structural growth tailwinds. Q3 FY26 showed stellar performance: profit up 45% to ₹917 Cr, revenue up 23.5% to ₹1,515 Cr, driven by QAAUM growth of 23.2% YoY to ₹10.8 Lakh Cr (13.3% market share, #2 AMC). Key competitive moat is ICICI Bank's closed architecture - 75% of bank's MF sales routed to ICICI Pru AMC via 7,246 branches = captive customer acquisition. Company is debt-free, cash-generative (95% FCF/PAT), and shareholder-friendly (80.5% dividend payout). However, valuation is RICH: P/E 46.8x (vs peers 35-42x), P/B 32.9x (vs peers 10-15x). Stock up 44% since IPO (Dec 19, 2025) = profit booking risk. Analyst consensus ₹3,350 implies 11% upside but limited margin of safety. Key risks: (1) Regulatory change forcing open architecture (would destroy bank distribution moat), (2) Bear market causing 20-30% AUM decline (56% equity exposure), (3) Valuation de-rating (P/E 46.8x vulnerable to compression), (4) Talent attrition (CIO departed Feb 2026). Unlike core blue chips, this is a recently listed high-valuation stock warranting closer risk management. Recommendation: HOLD existing 12 shares for 10-15% upside, but consider partial profit booking at ₹3,300+ to de-risk (lock gains on 50%, hold remaining 50% with trailing stop). Not a fresh BUY at current prices - wait for 10% correction to ₹2,700-2,800.

**Action Taken:**
- ✅ HOLD all 12 shares (quality growth story intact)
- ✅ GTT stop-loss: 12 shares at ₹2,700 (Trigger ID: 306064787)
- 📊 Monitoring: Q4 FY26 results (April), monthly QAAUM, net flow data, fund performance rankings
- 🎯 Price Alerts: Set at ₹3,300 (partial exit consideration) and ₹2,750 (buy opportunity)

**Follow-Up Schedule:**
- 📅 **Feb-Mar 2026**: Monitor for rally to ₹3,300-3,400 (SELL 6 shares = 50% if triggered to book ₹8-9k profit)
- 📅 **If dips to ₹2,700-2,800**: ADD 8-10 shares (₹25-30k) to accumulate on weakness
- 📅 **April 2026**: Q4 FY26 results - Watch QAAUM growth (>20%), net flows (positive?), fund performance vs benchmarks
- 📅 **Monthly**: Track AMFI data - ICICI Pru market share (must stay >13%), net equity flows
- 📅 **Quarterly**: Fund performance rankings - if >40% schemes underperform 1 year, redemption risk
- 🎯 **Price Targets**: ₹3,300 (short-term partial exit) | ₹3,400-3,600 (12M base case) | ₹3,800 (18-24M bull case)

**Position Strategy:**
- Current: 12 shares, ₹36,205 value (₹4,581 profit)
- **Partial Booking Strategy (if ₹3,300+ reached):**
  - Sell 6 shares @ ₹3,300 = ₹19,800, profit ₹4,000 on those 6 (locked)
  - Hold remaining 6 shares @ ₹2,635 avg with stop-loss ₹2,900
  - Rationale: De-risk after 25%+ gain in <2 months, rich valuation P/E 50x+ at ₹3,300
- **Accumulation Strategy (if dips to ₹2,700-2,800):**
  - Add 8-10 shares @ ₹2,750 = ₹22-27.5k investment
  - New total: 20-22 shares, avg ₹2,680-2,700
  - Better risk-reward at 10% lower price (P/E 42x vs 46.8x)

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ Stop-loss hit at ₹2,700 (trend breakdown, protect 14.5% gains)
- ✅ Partial exit (50%) at ₹3,300-3,400 (book profits, valuation extreme)
- ❌ Market share drops below 13% for 2 consecutive months (losing competitive edge)
- ❌ Net flows turn negative for 3 consecutive months (redemption pressure)
- ❌ >40% of funds underperform benchmarks for 1 year (performance risk)
- ❌ SEBI announces open architecture mandate (destroys bank distribution moat)
- ❌ P/E de-rates below 35x without earnings decline (valuation reset)
- ✅ Full exit if bear market: AUM down >25%, P/E compresses to 32x, target ₹2,300

**Key Thesis:** Wide-moat AMC with ICICI Bank distribution (75% sales), exceptional profitability (ROE 82%, margins 60%), structural growth (MF industry 20%+ CAGR, SIP culture). BUT rich valuation (P/E 46.8x, P/B 32.9x) limits upside, increases downside risk. HOLD for 10-15% upside but actively manage risk given recent listing, high valuations, and profit booking pressure. Not a buy-and-forget blue chip - requires tactical position management.

### 2026-02-09 | ICICI BANK | HOLD + TRAILING STOP-LOSS

**Position:** 141 shares @ ₹1,254.89 avg | Current: ₹1,398.30 | Gain: +11.56% (₹20,460)

**Decision:** HOLD existing position + GTT stop-loss at ₹1,280. Opportunistically add 30-40 shares if dips to ₹1,300-1,350.

**Rationale:** ICICI Bank is a wide-moat quality compounder trading at fair valuation with 15-20% upside potential. Q3 FY26 showed 4% profit decline due to one-time ₹1,283 Cr PSL provision (RBI agricultural loan classification issue), but core operations remain robust with NII up 7.7% and NIM stable at 4.30%. Asset quality best-in-class with GNPA improving from 1.96% to 1.53% YoY. Bank demonstrates strong fundamentals: ROE 18.2% (best-in-class), capital adequacy 16.8%, digital moat widening (10 TB data/day, 5.5 Cr+ iMobile users), and fortress balance sheet. Trading at P/E 19.8x (vs 10Y median 16.2x) and P/B 3.09x justified by superior asset quality and digital leadership. Analyst consensus target ₹1,690 implies 21% upside. Unlike Mankind Pharma's margin compression concerns, ICICI's operational strength intact - profit decline was one-time provision, not fundamental deterioration. Current 11.56% gain insufficient to trigger profit booking (threshold 30-40%). Position size appropriate for core blue-chip banking exposure.

**Action Taken:**
- ✅ HOLD all 141 shares (no selling)
- ✅ GTT stop-loss: 141 shares at ₹1,280 (Trigger ID: 306020402)
- 📊 Monitoring: Q4 FY26 results (April), NIM trend, GNPA trajectory, digital metrics
- 🎯 Price Alerts: Set at ₹1,320 (buy opportunity) and ₹1,450 (breakout level)

**Follow-Up Schedule:**
- 📅 **Feb-Mar 2026**: Monitor for dip to ₹1,300-1,350 accumulation zone (add 30-40 shares if triggered)
- 📅 **April 2026**: Q4 FY26 results - Watch NIM (must stay >4%), GNPA (must stay <2%), ROE (>17%)
- 📅 **July 2026**: Q1 FY27 results - Confirm normalized profitability post-provision spike
- 📅 **Quarterly**: Track asset quality, digital adoption metrics, regulatory developments
- 🎯 **Price Targets**: ₹1,500 (short-term) | ₹1,650 (12M base case) | ₹1,800 (18-24M bull case)

**Position Strategy:**
- Current: 141 shares, ₹1,97,690 invested
- If adds 40 shares @ ₹1,320: Total 181 shares, avg ₹1,269, investment ₹2,29,690

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ Stop-loss hit at ₹1,280 (trend breakdown, protect 11% gains)
- ❌ GNPA rises above 2% for 2 consecutive quarters (asset quality deteriorating)
- ❌ ROE drops below 16% sustainably (competitive advantage eroding)
- ❌ NIM falls below 4% (profitability pressure)
- ❌ Material RBI penalties or business restrictions
- ✅ Partial exit (30%) at ₹1,800+ if achieved in <18 months (re-evaluate on momentum)

**Key Thesis:** Wide-moat digital leader with fortress balance sheet, best-in-class asset quality (GNPA 1.53%), and consistent 18%+ ROE. Trading at fair value with limited downside risk and 15-20% base case upside. Core long-term holding for banking exposure. Q3 provision spike non-recurring, fundamentals intact.

### 2026-02-05 | KPIT TECHNOLOGIES | HOLD + STOP-LOSS

**Position:** 110 shares @ ₹1,151.10 avg | Current: ₹967.40 | Loss: -15.96% (₹20,207)

**Decision:** HOLD with stop-loss at ₹900 (biggest portfolio loss, needs monitoring)

**Rationale:** KPIT reported 22nd consecutive growth quarter with Q3 revenue up 9.5% but profit crashed 29% (₹133 Cr from ₹187 Cr) due to ₹60 Cr labor provision and margin compression (EBIT 15.6% vs 17.2% YoY). Excluding provision, profit still down 3.5%. Margin pressure is red flag but intrinsic value ₹1,235 vs current ₹967 shows 28% undervaluation. Multiple analysts target ₹1,341 (39% upside). Strong ROE 23.79% and structural sector tailwinds (software-defined vehicles, AI-infused mobility, autonomous driving) support long-term case. Stock corrected 16% from buy price - not a valuation trap but margin recovery critical. Hold with protection until Q4 confirms if margin pressure temporary or structural.

**Action Taken:**
- ✅ GTT stop-loss: 110 shares at ₹900 (Trigger ID: 305672287)
- 📊 Monitoring: Q3 results analysis, margin trends, automotive sector, European market health

**Follow-Up Schedule:**
- 📅 **February 2026**: Monitor ₹900 support level, watch automotive sector news
- 📅 **April-May 2026**: Q4 FY26 results - CRITICAL check for EBIT margin recovery (must be >16.5%)
- 📅 **July 2026**: Q1 FY27 results - Confirm margin trend direction (if >16%, upgrade; if <15%, exit)
- 📅 **Quarterly**: Track European automotive OEM earnings, order book momentum, TCV wins
- 🎯 **Price Targets**: ₹1,050-1,100 (3M) | ₹1,150-1,200 (6M) | ₹1,250-1,341 (12M)

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ Stop-loss hit at ₹900
- ❌ Q4 EBIT margin <15% (structural decline confirmed for 3+ quarters)
- ❌ Major client loss (>15% revenue impact) or European automotive recession
- ✅ Partial exit at ₹1,100-1,150 on rally if margin concerns persist

### 2026-02-05 | VA TECH WABAG | ACCUMULATE + STOP-LOSS

**Position:** 64 shares @ ₹1,243.46 avg | Current: ₹1,189 | Loss: -4.38% (₹3,485)

**Decision:** ACCUMULATE - Buy 20 more shares at ₹1,150 + GTT stop-loss at ₹1,000

**Rationale:** VA Tech Wabag shows strong fundamentals with ₹16,000 Cr order book providing 3.3x EPC and 8.6x O&M revenue visibility. Recent order wins include ₹3,251 Cr Saudi desalination project and ₹600 Cr BPCL contract. Q2 FY26 showed 19% revenue growth and 21% profit growth. Multiple analysts (B&K Securities, Systematix) initiated BUY ratings with 83-89% upside potential, projecting 15.7% revenue CAGR and 23% earnings CAGR (FY25-28E) with margin expansion to 14.6%. Water infrastructure sector has structural tailwinds (rising water stress, low wastewater treatment capacity). Current 4.38% loss presents accumulation opportunity given massive order book visibility and positive sector outlook.

**Action Taken:**
- ✅ GTT BUY order: 20 shares at ₹1,150 (Trigger ID: 305665451)
- ✅ GTT stop-loss: 64 shares at ₹1,000 (Trigger ID: 305665456)
- 📊 Monitoring: Q3 results (Feb 5), order book additions, margin trends, working capital

**Follow-Up Schedule:**
- 📅 **Feb 5-10, 2026**: Q3 FY26 results - Watch revenue growth (>15%), margins (>13%), new orders
- 📅 **After Buy Executes**: Update stop-loss from 64 to 84 shares at ₹1,000 (cancel old GTT, place new)
- 📅 **May 2026**: Q4 FY26 results - Full year performance and FY27 guidance
- 📅 **Quarterly**: Order book updates, new wins, execution pace
- 🎯 **Price Targets**: ₹1,350-1,400 (6M) | ₹1,500-1,600 (12M) | ₹1,800-2,000 (18-24M)

**Position After Buy Executes:**
- Total Shares: 84 (64 current + 20 new)
- New Average: ~₹1,230 (improved from ₹1,243)
- Total Investment: ~₹1,03,500

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ Stop-loss hit at ₹1,000 (protect capital)
- ❌ Order book growth slows significantly or major cancellations

- ✅ Partial exit (30-40%) at ₹1,500 to book profit and reduce risk
- ✅ Trail stop-loss upward as stock appreciates

### 2026-02-05 | INDIGO | HOLD + TRAILING STOP-LOSS

**Position:** 22 shares @ ₹4,726.46 avg | Current: ₹4,875 | Gain: +3.14% (₹3,268)

**Decision:** HOLD with trailing stop-loss at ₹4,500 (breakeven protection)

**Rationale:** IndiGo's Q3 profit collapsed 77% to ₹550 Cr due to ₹15.5 billion exceptional charges (December operational chaos costing ₹5.8B, forex losses of ₹10.4B, and labor reform charges of ₹9.7B). However, core revenue grew 6.7% and most charges are one-time/non-recurring. Fleet expansion continues aggressively (440 aircraft, +57 in 2025) supporting long-term growth. Unlike Mankind's valuation trap, IndiGo's issues are operational/exceptional. Key risks: ongoing forex exposure with rupee volatility and operational efficiency. Stop-loss at ₹4,500 protects near breakeven while allowing recovery if Q4 shows clean profitability without exceptional items.

**Action Taken:**
- ✅ GTT stop-loss order placed at ₹4,500 (Trigger ID: 305631403)
- 📊 Monitoring: Forex losses trend, operational efficiency, load factor, ex-exceptional profitability

**Follow-Up Schedule:**
- 📅 **April 15-30, 2026**: Q4 FY26 results - Check for forex loss continuation and operational improvements
- 📅 **July 2026**: Q1 FY27 results - Assess if profitability normalizes post-exceptional items
- 📅 **Monthly**: Track USD/INR forex trends (impacts aircraft lease costs)
- 🎯 **Price Alerts**: ₹5,200 (reassess upside potential) | ₹4,500 (stop-loss trigger)

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ Stop-loss hit at ₹4,500
- ❌ Q4 shows continued forex losses >₹8B or operational margins deteriorate
- ✅ Upgrade to accumulate if Q4 profit >₹1,500 Cr (ex-exceptional items)

### 2026-02-05 | MANKIND PHARMA | HOLD + STOP-LOSS

**Position:** 100 shares @ ₹2,290.33 avg | Current: ₹2,085 | Loss: -8.96% (₹20,533)

**Decision:** HOLD with strict monitoring + GTT stop-loss at ₹1,950 (-15%)

**Rationale:** Mankind Pharma reported mixed Q3 results with revenue growth of 11.5% but concerning EBITDA margin compression from 25.6% to 22.9%. The stock trades at a premium valuation of 45x P/E versus pharma peers (Sun: 30x, Cipla: 28x, Dr. Reddy's: 35x), raising valuation trap concerns. While revenue growth remains healthy and analyst targets suggest 18% upside to ₹2,460, the margin pressure needs resolution. Key watch points: Q4 margin recovery and peer performance. Stop-loss protects against further downside if fundamentals deteriorate. Will reassess if margins don't stabilize by Q1 FY27.

**Action Taken:**
- ✅ GTT stop-loss order placed at ₹1,950 (Trigger ID: 305578263)
- 📊 Monitoring: EBITDA margins, P/E compression, Q4 results, peer comparison

**Follow-Up Schedule:**
- 📅 **April-May 2026**: Q4 FY26 results - Critical check for EBITDA margin recovery (target: >24%)
- 📅 **July 2026**: Q1 FY27 results - Assess if margin compression trend reverses
- 📅 **Monthly**: Compare P/E with pharma peers (Sun, Cipla, Dr. Reddy's) for valuation gap
- 🎯 **Price Alerts**: ₹2,200 (reassess exit on bounce) | ₹2,460 (analyst target, book profit) | ₹1,950 (stop-loss trigger)

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✅ Stop-loss hit at ₹1,950
- ❌ EBITDA margins stay below 24% for 2 consecutive quarters
- ❌ P/E remains >40x while peers trade at <35x with better margins
- ✅ Partial exit at ₹2,200-2,300 range to reduce risk exposure
