Act as a Strategic Consultant and Industry Expert. Generate a comparative analysis dossier contrasting {Company A} and {Company B} within the {Industry}, specifically focusing on **Structural Advantages (Moats), Customer dependency, and Supply Chain resilience.**

**Objective:**
- Determine which company possesses a "Durable Moat" (Pricing Power/Network Effects) versus a fleeting advantage.
- Analyze "Bargaining Power": Who controls the value chain (Suppliers -> Company -> Distributors -> Customers)?
- Assess "Concentration Risk" in both customer base and raw material sourcing.

**Inputs:**
- Peers: {Company A}, {Company B}
- Industry: {Industry}
- Context: Indian Market (focus on General Trade vs. Modern Trade, Rural vs. Urban split, Import dependence).

**Data Collection:**
- **Specific Indian Sources:** 
  - **Credit Rating Reports (CRISIL, ICRA, CARE):** Look for the "Key Rating Drivers" section which explicitly details customer/supplier concentration risks.
  - **Concall Transcripts:** Search for keywords like "channel inventory," "distributor margin," "China dependence," "raw material volatility," and "stickiness."
  - **Annual Report (Management Discussion & Analysis):** Look for "Sourcing Strategy" and "Distribution Network" depth (Tier 2/3 penetration).
  - **Brokerage Channel Checks:** Insights on dealer feedback.
- **Search Queries:** 
  - "{Company A} CRISIL rating report 2024 customer concentration"
  - "{Company B} sourcing strategy China dependence"
  - "{Company A} vs {Company B} distributor margin and network reach"

**Normalization:**
- **Distribution:** Standardize terms (e.g., "Touchpoints" vs. "Outlets"). Differentiate between Direct Coverage and Indirect Reach.
- **Geography:** Group into Metros, Tier-1, and Tier-2+ (Bharat).

**Output Format:**
Generate a structured Markdown report. Tables first, followed by narrative insights (Context → Insight → Implication → KPI).

**1. Executive Summary (Moat & Ecosystem)**
   - **Moat Verdict:** Which company has the wider moat and why? (Brand, Low Cost, Switching Cost).
   - **Power Dynamic:** Who holds the leverage? The company, the supplier, or the distributor?
   - **Vulnerability Check:** Top 3 supply chain or customer risks unique to the Indian context (e.g., geopolitical import restrictions).

**2. SECTION A — The Moat Inspection (Porter’s Lens)**
   - Compare specific moat sources:
     - **Intangibles:** Brand recall (Urban vs. Rural trust).
     - **Switching Costs:** Tech integration or workflow embeddedness.
     - **Cost Advantage:** Scale or proprietary process.
   - *Table: Moat Strength Scorecard (1-5).*

**3. SECTION B — Customer Concentration & "Stickiness"**
   - **B2B:** Top 5/10 Client contribution % (Revenue risk).
   - **B2C:** Brand Loyalty (Repeat purchase rates / Net Retention).
   - **Channel Mix:** Dependence on General Trade (Kiranas) vs. E-commerce/Modern Trade.

**4. SECTION C — Supplier Power & Sourcing Risk**
   - **Import Dependency:** Exposure to China or volatile global commodities.
   - **Raw Material Pass-through:** Ability to pass on price hikes to customers without losing volume.
   - **Supplier Concentration:** Single-vendor risks vs. diversified base.

**5. SECTION D — Distribution & Logistics Architecture**
   - **Reach:** Number of retail touchpoints / pin codes covered.
   - **Efficiency:** Inventory days in the channel (Channel stuffing risk).
   - **Incentives:** Distributor margins and trade scheme aggression.

**6. SECTION E — Regulatory & "License to Operate"**
   - **PLI Schemes:** Benefits received vs. competitor.
   - **Compliance:** Track record with pollution control/FDA (for Pharma/Chem) or RBI (for Finance).

**Quality Checks:**
- Highlight "Single Point of Failure" risks.
- Distinguish between "Reported Reach" and "Active Reach" if data permits.
- Ensure the "India vs. Bharat" distinction is clear in distribution analysis.
