Act as a Forensic Accountant and CFO Advisor. Generate a comparative "Cost Structure & Margin Waterfall" dossier for {Company A} and {Company B} within the {Industry}.

**Objective:**
- Deconstruct the P&L to identify which company is the "Low Cost Producer" or has superior "Operating Leverage."
- Identify where money leaks (inefficiencies) versus where it is invested (R&D/Marketing).
- Stress test margins against inflation (Raw Material/Power/Employee costs).

**Inputs:**
- Peers: {Company A}, {Company B}
- Industry: {Industry}
- Currency: INR (Crores/Lakhs)

**Data Collection:**
- **Specific Indian Sources:** 
  - **Annual Report (Notes to Accounts):** Extract detailed schedules for "Other Expenses," "Employee Benefits," and "Cost of Materials Consumed."
  - **Quarterly Investor Presentations:** Bridge charts (EBITDA walks).
  - **Peer Comparison Tables:** From Screeners (Tijori/Screener.in data points found in text).
- **Search Queries:** 
  - "{Company A} annual report notes to accounts employee cost breakdown"
  - "{Company B} power and fuel cost as percentage of sales"
  - "{Company A} vs {Company B} logistics cost efficiency"

**Normalization:**
- **Common Sizing:** Convert all line items to **% of Revenue from Operations**.
- **Cost Buckets:** Group "Freight," "Forwarding," and "Distribution" into "Logistics." Group "Power," "Fuel," and "Utilities" together.

**Output Format:**
Generate a structured Markdown report. Focus on "Variance Analysis" (Why is Company A higher/lower than B?).

**1. Executive Summary (The Efficiency Verdict)**
   - **Margin Leader:** Who retains more profit per rupee of sales and why?
   - **Operating Leverage:** Which company expands margins faster as revenue grows?
   - **Cost Alert:** The single biggest cost divergence between the two peers.

**2. SECTION A — The Margin Ladder (Side-by-Side)**
   - Table comparing: Gross Margin → EBITDA Margin → EBIT Margin → PAT Margin.
   - *Analysis:* Explain the drop-off at each step. (e.g., "Company A has better Gross Margins but loses it all in high Employee Costs").

**3. SECTION B — COGS & Gross Margin Drivers**
   - **Raw Material Intensity:** RM Cost as % of Sales.
   - **Pricing Power:** Evidence of price hikes improving GM%.
   - **Inventory Gains/Losses:** Impact of commodity cycle timing.

**4. SECTION C — Operating Expense Deep Dive (Common Size)**
   - **Employee Costs:** Cost per employee or % of sales (Check for bloating).
   - **Power & Fuel:** Crucial for manufacturing (Efficiency check).
   - **Logistics & Supply Chain:** Cost to serve (Crucial for FMCG/Retail).
   - **A&P (Advertising & Promotion):** Share of voice vs. Share of market efficiency.

**5. SECTION D — Working Capital & Cash Conversion**
   - **Cash Conversion Cycle:** Debtor Days + Inventory Days - Payable Days.
   - **Quality of Earnings:** EBITDA to Operating Cash Flow conversion ratio (Is profit real cash?).
   - **Bad Debts:** Provisions written off (Indication of aggressive sales booking).

**6. SECTION E — Return Ratios (The DuPont Analysis)**
   - Break down ROCE into: Net Profit Margin × Asset Turnover.
   - Determine if high returns are driven by "Pricing Power" (Margin) or "Sweating Assets" (Turnover).

**Quality Checks:**
- **The "Other Expenses" Trap:** If "Other Expenses" is >15% of sales, breakdown the components (Look for hidden RPTs or CSR bloat).
- **Forex Impact:** Note if margins are impacted by currency fluctuation (Hedging costs).
- Explicitly state if margins are sustainable or one-off (e.g., inventory gain).
- Context → Insight → Implication → KPI format for narratives.
