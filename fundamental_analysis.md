### SECTION 2: MOAT ANALYSIS (Critical)

Evaluate each moat source. Rate as STRONG / MODERATE / WEAK / ABSENT with evidence:

| Network Effects | | |
| Cost Advantage / Scale | | |
| Regulatory / License Barrier | | |
| Intangible Assets (patents, data, relationships) | | |

**Moat Durability Test:**
